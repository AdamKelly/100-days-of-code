## 100 Days of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 5th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started to read "Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python, 4th Edition" by Al Sweigart as I was familiar with his work. Read up to chapter 6. The provided example games are not coding challenges as such, so I wrote a magic 8 ball type script just for fun.

**Thoughts:** I do have python experience but I've let it slip a bit in recent times. No harm in going back to basics to brush up again.

### Day 2: October 6th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today was get requests and manipulating the returned data, namely how many people are in space right now.

**Thoughts:** Iterating over nested dictionaries can be tough at times. It works but I'm sure I can make it better.

### Day 3: October 7th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Wrote a python script which opens an email template even if Outlook is closed. The recipient, subject, and a html table are included. The idea is to plan the six most important tasks to accomplish the following day using the Ivy Lee method. At the moment it triggers the email at 21:00 each night via Windows Task Scheduler.

**Thoughts:** Finding out how to display the html table properly was the longest part.

### Day 4: October 8th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Went back to the python game book. Currently working through the Hangman game.

**Thoughts:** Coding at night is a bad idea :)

### Day 5: October 9th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Stumbled across the book ‚ÄúPython Crash Course‚Äù by Eric Matthes and got sucked right in. Sometimes it nice to revise the fundamentals and smash the basic exercises üòä Worked on hangman again which gave me some ideas for a side project. 

**Thoughts:** Happy with today's work as I had forgotten some of the basics.

**Link to work:** All exercises were stored locally today.

### Day 6: October 10th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the chapter on lists and completed all the exercises.

**Thoughts:** Will code in the morning tomorrow.
