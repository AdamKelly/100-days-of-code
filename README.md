## 100 Days of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 5th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started to read "Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python, 4th Edition" by Al Sweigart as I was familiar with his work. Read up to chapter 6. The provided example games are not coding challenges as such, so I wrote a magic 8 ball type script just for fun.

**Thoughts:** I do have python experience but I've let it slip a bit in recent times. No harm in going back to basics to brush up again.
